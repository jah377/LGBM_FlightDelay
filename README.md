# Applied Machine Learning (5294APML6Y): Flight Delay Prediction

This repository contains code corresponding to the analyses presented in the Project Symposium for the Applied Machine Learning course, in partial fulfillment for the degree of MSc. in Data Science at the University of Amsterdam.

## Executive Summary

Accurate predictions result from the aggregated effect of many non-trivial decisions, not just algorithm selection. An ablation study was conducted to investigate the effect of decisions related to feature encoding techniques, algorithm selection, and hyperparameter tuning on flight delay predictions. Models tested included Light Gradient Boosting and simple Neural Network. Explored techniques include label and one-hot encoding categorical features; experimental cyclic encoding of temporal features was additionally investigated. Results suggest that creatively extracting additional features dramatically reduced mean squared error compared to the tested encoding techniques.
